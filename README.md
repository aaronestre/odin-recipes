# The Odin Project: Recipes Project
---
This project aims to showcase what I have learned about HTML through the introductory course on The Odin Project's website.

Most of the course focused on the very basics of HTML such as explaining the various elements and tags that are used to lay the foundation of webpages. Going into the course I already knew these basics but it was a nice refresher. It also taught good practices to follow, such as important attributes to consider when writing anchor tags to open links in new windows to avoid potential tabnapping attacks. 

Some of the more important information that I learned was about Git, specifically about commit messages and how to write them properly. During my time in college, Git wasn't taught in depth, and I felt that I lacked in that area. This course provided great resources that taught me more of the basics and standards for Git.
